# Neo-Oceanic colour scheme for Neovim

Heavily inspired by my long-time favourite Oceanic Next for [vim](https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next) 
(see also the original for [Sublime](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme)).
Credit goes also to the [Lua plugin version](https://github.com/roflolilolmao/oceanic-next.nvim).

## Installation

Public repository is set up in the standard manner such that any mainstream plugin
manager should work. For example, using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
simply add
`Plug 'plowman-c/neo-oceanic'`
along with your other plugins.
